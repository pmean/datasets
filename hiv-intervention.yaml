description: > 
  This is a longitudinal study of an
  intervention in 14-18 adolescents 
  intended to increase the frequency
  of condom protected sex. Subjects 
  were allocated randomly to treatment
  or control groups. All were evaluated
  prior to the intervention, immediately 
  after the intervention, 6 months and 
  12 months after the intervention.The
  outcome variable is the
  logarithm-transformed frequency of
  condom-protected sex ( log(Y+1) )."
