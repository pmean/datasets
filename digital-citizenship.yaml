description: >
  From the original source: This dataset was 
  used in our study that investigated the 
  psychometric properties of the Digital 
  Citizenship Scale (DCS), originally 
  developed by Choi, Glassman and Cristol.
  1915 responses were gathered in late 2018
  and 1820 responses with valid data from 
  three countries were analysed (Canada, 
  n=817; Australia, n=589; and Slovenia, 
  n=414). The dataset also included 
  Big-Factor-Five personality data as well.
