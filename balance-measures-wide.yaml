description:  
  The study examined balance for subjects on two
  different floor conditions (normal or foam) and
  with three different levels of sight (eyes open,
  eyes closed, or closed dome). Each of these
  conditions was replicated twice. The outcome 
  measure was an ordinal variable on a scale from
  1 to 4.

note:  
  The dataset shows how to display repeated measures
  data using the wide format. An alternate 
  dataset, balance2.txt, displays the data using the
  tall format.
