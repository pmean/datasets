description:
  This data set shows a perceptual experiment where subjects were asked
  to estimate a size ratio with their head level to the ground and then
  with their head elevated (in other words, looking upward). Although
  the objects being compared were the same size, almost all subjects 
  overestimated the relative sizes. The hypothesis to be tested is 
  whether the overestimation is greater with eyes level than with eyes
  elevated.
