description: >
  This is a modification/simplification of
  the digital-citizenship data set. An
  aggregate variable, internet_sum, was
  computed as the sum of the 27 internet 
  variables. The categories for Age were 
  recoded down into three categories. Rows
  associated with Country=Other and United
  States were removed. Many
  other variables were removed.
