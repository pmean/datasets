description: >
  Foot progression angle (FPA) is typically
  measured using an expensive pressure
  platform, but this dataset examines a
  simpler approach using water, absorbent 
  paper, and a goniometer. Thirteen 
  children were assessed both on the 
  left foot and the right foot. This was 
  repeated two weeks later. In this study,
  all the assessments were negative, 
  representing in-toeing gait.
