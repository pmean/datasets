Description: > 
  "Behavioural Skills Training and 
  Protected Sex. The data give the
  results of an study aimed at reducing
  the risk of HIV infection among
  African-American adolescents. The 
  subjects were 14-18 year old female 
  and male adolescents in a Southern 
  USA city. The study compared two 
  interventions. The treatment 
  intervention was an 8-week 
  Behavioural Skills Training (BST) 
  program. The control was an single 
  2-hour education session about HIV
  and AIDS. The subjects completed 
  sexual attitude and activity 
  questionnaires before and after the
  intervention and at 6-month and 
  12-month follow-ups. The data here 
  are for 10 subjects for each 
  intervention although the original 
  study was much larger. The data 
  given here appear to have been 
  created by Howell (1999) based on 
  summary statistics from the original
  study. The dependent variable is the
  logarithm-transformed frequency of
  condom-protected sex ( log(Y+1) )."

Analysis
There is an interaction between intervention and time of measurement.
