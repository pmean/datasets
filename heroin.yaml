description: >
  This dataset shows information about heroin
  addicts who are treated at two rehabilitation
  clinics. It is useful for showing (among other
  things) how to identify and control for the
  clinic factor which does not meet the assumptions
  of proportional hazards needed by the standard
  Cox regression model.
