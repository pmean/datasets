description: 
  The data was collected by Peter Drew and
  Matt Seidemann, statistics students at the
  Queensland University of Technology, in a
  subject taught by Dr Margaret Mackisack. 
  Here is their description. "As keen 
  fishermen out and about on a fairly 
  regular basis, the common arguments arise
  between anglers on the best rigging set up
  for various conditions. We decided that
  upon our next group outing that we would
  back up our opinions with hard statistical
  facts. Our interest led us to test the 
  most obvious variables in the fishing rig. 
  Of interest were firstly the rod length, 
  as between fisherman there always tends to
  be a variety of rods of different sizes; 
  secondly the type of line, in that the 
  larger the line it would be logical that 
  the weight would increase; thirdly the 
  sinker weight and how it affected the 
  casting distance."
