description: >
  The data was collected by Peter Drew and
  Matt Seidemann, statistics students at the
  Queensland University of Technology, in a
  subject taught by Dr Margaret Mackisack. 
  They ran a simple experiment looking at 
  factors affecting the distance that a 
  fishing line was cast based on the rod,
  line, and sinker.
