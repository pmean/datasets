description: >
  Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has
  helped many infertile couples, but there are
  concerns about the risks during pregnancy
  and child birth. This paper found 11 studies
  that examined whether the risk of
  malpresentation (e.g., breech births) was
  higher in ART pregnancies compared to natural
  conception (NC).
