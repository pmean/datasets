description: >
  From the Ryan et al article: "In autumn, small
  winged fruit called samara fall off maple trees,
  spinning as they go. A forest scientist studied
  the relationship between how fast they fell and
  their "disk loading" (a quantity based on their
  size and weight). The samara disk loading is 
  related to the aerodynamics of helicopters."
