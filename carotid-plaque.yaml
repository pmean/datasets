description: >
  The details on this dataset are a bit vague
  because the article associated with this data
  is hidden behind a paywall. Ultarsonagraphy
  was used to identify carotid plaque and/or
  cerebrovascular disease. The imaging produced
  measures of Von Mises strain. The key measure
  is peak, which appears to be an average or a
  maximum over four or five cycles. There are
  separate measurements at systole and diastole.
