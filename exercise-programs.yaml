description: > 
  This dataset is used in a tutorial about
  interactions. A description from the
  original source: The dataset consists of
  data describing the amount of weight loss
  achieved by 900 participants in a
  year-long study of 3 different exercise
  programs, a jogging program, a swimming
  program, and a reading program which
  serves as a control activity. Researchers
  were interested in how the weekly number
  of hours subjects chose to exercise
  predicted weight loss.
