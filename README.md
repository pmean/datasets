# datasets

This repository stores various datasets that I use in my talks and my classes. It does not include any datasets that I use in my private consulting practice. Those datasets are assumed to be owned by the client and would only be stored in a private repository.

I will eventually consolidate all the datasets that I have stored in various other repositories here. Some of the repositories that I need to move data from include

-   [introduction-to-r][inr]
-   [introduction-to-sas][isa]

For many of the datasets in this repository, the copyright is not clearly stated anywhere that I could find. Use by individuals for educational purposes is probably acceptable under the Fair Use provisions of copyright law.

If you own the copyright to any of these datasets and wish to clarify the conditions under which they can be used, please contact me (mail@pmean.com). If I am not allowed to store your data on my repository, I would be glad to remove your dataset.

Here are the datasets in this repository so far:

-   **absorbent-paper**: Foot progression angle (FPA) is typically measured using an expensive pressure platform, but this dataset examines a simpler approach using water, absorbent  paper, and a goniometer. Thirteen  children were assessed both on the  left foot and the right foot. This was  repeated two weeks later. In this study, all the assessments were negative,  representing in-toeing gait.

-   **airline-bumping**: This dataset shows the number of times passengers were "bumped" from an airline flight. Bumping occurs when an airline overbooks reservations for a flight. Normally, the airline will ask for volunteers who will agree to take a later flight in exchange for cash or travel vouchers. But if no one volunteers, airlines will involuntarily bump passengers from the flight.

-   **art-malpresentations**: Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has helped many infertile couples, but there are concerns about the risks during pregnancy and child birth. This paper found 11 studies that examined whether the risk of malpresentation (e.g., breech births) was higher in ART pregnancies compared to natural conception (NC).

-   **breast-feeding-preterm**: This data comes from a research study done at Children's Mercy Hospital and St. Luke's Medical Center. This was a study of breast feeding in  pre-term infants. Infants were randomized into either a treatment group (NG tube) or a control group (Bottle). Infants in the NG tube group  were fed in the hospital via their nasogastral tube when the mother was not available for breast feeding. Infants in the bottle group received bottles when the mothers were not available. Both groups were monitored for six months after discharge from the hospital.

Ultarsonagraphy was used to identify carotid plaque and/or cerebrovascular disease. The imaging produced measures of Von Mises strain. The key measure is peak, which appears to be an average or a maximum over four or five cycles. There are separate measurements at systole and diastole.

-   **moon**: This data set shows a perceptual experiment where subjects were asked to estimate a size ratio with their head level to the ground and then with their head elevated (in other words, looking upward). Although the objects being compared were the same size, almost all subjects  overestimated the relative sizes. The hypothesis to be tested is  whether the overestimation is greater with eyes level than with eyes elevated.

A forest scientist studied the relationship between how fast they fell and their "disk loading" (a quantity based on their size and weight). The samara disk loading is  related to the aerodynamics of helicopters."

-   **titanic**: The Titanic was a large cruise ship,  the biggest of its kind in 1912. It  was thought to be unsinkable, but  when it set sail from England to  America in its maiden voyage, it  struck an iceberg and sank, killing  many of the passengers and crew. You can get fairly good data on the  characteristics of passengers who  died and compare them to those that  survived. The data indicate a strong  effect due to age and gender,  representing a philosophy of  "women and children first" that held during the boarding of life boats.

-   **transplant**: This data dictionary provides information about a dataset that for a variety of reasons, comes in four different files. Two files of the files (transplant.txt and transplant1.csv) are identical except for formatting and are represented with one row per patient. Another two files (heart.csv and transplant2.csv) are also identical except for formatting and are represented using start-stop coding. For these two data sets, an extra row is needed for patients who switch the covariate pattern in the middle of the study.
