# datasets

This repository stores various datasets that I use in my talks and my classes. It does not include any datasets that I use in my private consulting practice. Those datasets are assumed to be owned by the client and would only be stored in a private repository.

For many of the datasets in this repository, the copyright is not clearly stated anywhere that I could find. Use by individuals for educational purposes is probably acceptable under the Fair Use provisions of copyright law.

If you own the copyright to any of these datasets and wish to clarify the conditions under which they can be used, please contact me (mail@pmean.com). If I am not allowed to store the data on this repository, I would be glad to remove the dataset.

I will eventually consolidate all the datasets that I have stored in various other repositories here. Some of the repositories that I need to move data from include

-   [classes][cla]
-   [data-dictonaries][dat]
-   [introduction-to-r][inr]
-   [introduction-to-sas][isa]
-   [introduction-to-sql][isq]
-   [survival-models][sur]

is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
