# datasets

This repository stores various datasets that I use in my talks and my classes. It does not include any datasets that I use in my private consulting practice. Those datasets are assumed to be owned by the client and would only be stored in a private repository.

I will eventually consolidate all the datasets that I have stored in various other repositories here. Some of the repositories that I need to move data from include

-   [classes][cla]
-   [data-dictonaries][dat]
-   [introduction-to-r][inr]
-   [introduction-to-sas][isa]
-   [introduction-to-sql][isq]
-   [survival-models][sur]

For many of the datasets in this repository, the copyright is not clearly stated anywhere that I could find. Use by individuals for educational purposes is probably acceptable under the Fair Use provisions of copyright law.

If you own the copyright to any of these datasets and wish to clarify the conditions under which they can be used, please contact me (mail@pmean.com). If I am not allowed to store your data on my repository, I would be glad to remove your dataset.

Here are the datasets in this repository so far:

-   **absorbent-paper**: Foot progression angle (FPA) is typically measured using an expensive pressure platform, but this dataset examines a simpler approach using water, absorbent  paper, and a goniometer. Thirteen  children were assessed both on the  left foot and the right foot. This was  repeated two weeks later. In this study, all the assessments were negative,  representing in-toeing gait.

-   **art-malpresentations**: Assisted reproductive technology (ART) has helped many infertile couples, but there are concerns about the risks during pregnancy and child birth. This paper found 11 studies that examined whether the risk of malpresentation (e.g., breech births) was higher in ART pregnancies compared to natural conception (NC).

-   **diamonds**: The data is intended to teach some lessons about regression models. The size of a diamond, as well as some categorical descriptors (color and clarity) are listed for 308 diamonds, along with their sales price.

-   **fat**: This dataset includes two measures of body fat (a quantity  that is normally quite difficult to measure) along with some simpler measures of body size that could be used to predict body fat.

-   **glycyrrhizin**: This data is from a meta-analysis of the  effectiveness of glycyrrhizin, an herbal medicine that is thought to have some anti-allergenic and immune boosting effects. This study examined its use in treating chronic urticaria, a condition characterized by rashes and/or angiodema. The researchers found 24 randomized trials addressing this topic. The outcome was the total efficiency rate, defined as a binary outcome based on the Urticaria Symptom Score Reduction Index.

-   **hiv-intervention**: This is a longitudinal study of an intervention in 14-18 adolescents  intended to increase the frequency of condom protected sex. Subjects  were allocated randomly to treatment or control groups. All were evaluated prior to the intervention, immediately  after the intervention, 6 months and  12 months after the intervention.The outcome variable is the logarithm-transformed frequency of condom-protected sex ( log(Y+1) )."

-   **titanic**: The Titanic was a large cruise ship,  the biggest of its kind in 1912. It  was thought to be unsinkable, but  when it set sail from England to  America in its maiden voyage, it  struck an iceberg and sank, killing  many of the passengers and crew. You can get fairly good data on the  characteristics of passengers who  died and compare them to those that  survived. The data indicate a strong  effect due to age and gender,  representing a philosophy of  "women and children first" that held during the boarding of life boats.More information is available at http://www.statsci.org/data/general/titanic.html

-   **vaccine-willingness**: This paper identified seven studies that examined vaccine literacy (VL).  Patients in these studies also stated their  vaccine prefernce and were categorized  as willing or unwilling.
