  This data is from a meta-analysis of the 
  effectiveness of glycyrrhizin, an herbal
  medicine that is thought to have some
  anti-allergenic and immune boosting effects.
  This study examined its use in treating
  chronic urticaria, a condition characterized
  by rashes and/or angiodema. The researchers
  found 24 randomized trials addressing this
  topic. The outcome was the total efficiency
  rate, defined as a binary outcome based on
  the Urticaria Symptom Score Reduction Index.
