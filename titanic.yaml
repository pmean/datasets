description: >
  The Titanic was a large cruise ship, 
  the biggest of its kind in 1912. It 
  was thought to be unsinkable, but 
  when it set sail from England to 
  America in its maiden voyage, it 
  struck an iceberg and sank, killing 
  many of the passengers and crew. You
  can get fairly good data on the 
  characteristics of passengers who 
  died and compare them to those that 
  survived. The data indicate a strong 
  effect due to age and gender, 
  representing a philosophy of 
  "women and children first" that held
  during the boarding of life boats.
